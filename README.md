# Random Quotes ReadMe

1. Go to *server* folder and run *npm install* then *npm start*.

2. Go to *client* folder and run *npm install* then *npm start*.

3. Server will run at http://localhost:5000. 
    - You can make GET and POST calls to http://localhost:5000/quotes.
    - There is a calls.http file with some examples.

4. Client will run at http://localhost:3000.
    - You'll get a random quote everytime you load the page or click at 'Get a New Quote' button.
    - Clicking at 'Add a New Quote' button will lead you to a page where you can add new quotes.

5. At client folder, you can run *npm test* to run all unit tests and see the coverage.

*P.s.: I'm using a personal cloud DB, so the data will persist even if the server is stopped.*
